All minutes of the meetings of the tenure **should be documented and uploaded as pdf** in the drive folder named "Minutes Of The Meetings". The name of the document should be in the format "< Tenure Start Year > - < Tenure End Year >.pdf". **Follow the exact template** as present in the document named Template present in the drive folder.
- **Add new ideas and the incomplete work to the issues tab** of this repository so that they can be passed on easily.
- [Get Society Wiki Page](https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/Category:Societies_and_clubs) updated by the respective societies; **use last year's mail** as the template (available in official Gmail account with subject "Update Your Organisation's MetaKGP Wiki Page"). Take email address of all previous governors of all societies from the past PR chair and send them a mail to update the wiki page.
- Posts which are to be sent every year are present in the current GitHub repository; they must be sent again or removed after discussion with former Technology Coordinator.
- Events to be managed are present in the folder events. These should either be conducted every academic year or marked with "[STALE]" if considered outdated or not to be done. A future coordinator may decide to restart them with discussion with former TechCord.
- As the new Gymkhana editors are announced, an account for each should be made and credentials should be given. Along with the same, last year user accounts should be removed and their contribution should be attributed to the Technology Coordinator account. Share docs on the Ghost platform, and make sure they're comfortable with it.
- A project timeline should be created by the Technology Coordinator at the beginning of the tenure and in the same, s/he should circulate a document asking all of the Gymkhana position holders to suggest updates for the website.
